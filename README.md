# ros2-py-path-planning-server 
This repo implements a ROS2 server for computing the path planning required for the [Future Mobility Lab: Autonomous Vehicle Project](https://github.com/GeorgeTMartin/FML_AutonomousCar)


## Planners 

- [x] A* 
- [ ] RRT 
- [ ] RRT*
- [ ] PRM

## TODO List:

- [x] Create Graph from map
- [x] Implement A* Proof of Concept 
- [x] Create ROS2 server/client Proof of Concept
- [x] Refactor ROS2 Path service to create solve A* 
- [ ] Solve RRT/RRT*/PRM 
- [ ] Add RRT/RRT*/PRM algorithm support to Path service
