\section{Future Recommendations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Gradient-based grid map cell weighting(prevent wall hugging)
  \item Global and Local planners (would be alot better if you did)
  \item Inflation relaxation to try and find feasible path if initial parameterization is infeasible.
  \item Curvature or constraint based path smoothing
\end{itemize}
