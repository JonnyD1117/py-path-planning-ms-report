\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{R}{obotics} is a broad, complex, and multifaceted field of study that integrates a wide range of technical disciplines. One of the most visible applications of robotics, in the public consciousness, is the emergence of autonomous vehicles and the advancements in technology and computing which has made it feasible. The task of automating the movement of a vehicle or robot in a safe, practical, and reliable manner is a complex endeavor that engages many tough societal and technical issues. One of the most fundamental technical challenges is the task of \textbf{path planning}. This problem is of primary importance as the creation of a feasible path through a known or unknown space is often the first of many stages in a guidance and navigation stack.

The broad objective of this paper is to survey a selection of the most popular path planners in use today, juxtapose their relative merits, and contextualize the process of constructing and implementing these algorithms in Python to test their performance. Additionally, this paper covers the post-processing of path planner waypoints into a usable continuous path for certain realworld applications.
