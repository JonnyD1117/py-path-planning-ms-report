\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{R}{obotics} is a broad, complex, and multifaceted field of study that integrates a wide range of technical disciplines. One of the most visible applications of robotics, in the public consciousness, is the emergence of autonomous vehicles. The task of automating the movement of a vehicle or robot in a safe, practical, and reliable manner is a complex field of study that investigates many tough societal and technical issues. In particular, one of the most fundamental challenges is that of \textbf{path planning} since the creation of a feasible path for the system to traverse is usually the first step in the process of navigating in complex environments.

The broad objective of this paper is to survey the most fundamental and popular path planners in use today, to implement these planners in Python, juxtapose their relative merits, and to contextualize the process of constructing and using these planners from the building blocks of raw sensor input to the final output of waypoints being fed to a controller.
